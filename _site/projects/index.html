  Here's a pretty exhaustive list of every project I've worked on during my college and graduate years.

</p>

<ul>


  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/website/">
      This Website
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>Built with Jekyll</span><br/>
    <span>Personal | 2023</span><br/>

    

    <p><p>Building this website from scratch</p>
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/espnet_onnx/">
      ESPnet ONNX
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>Optimizing the ESPnet speech toolkit for production applications</span><br/>
    <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ Karthik Ganesan, Samarth Navali, Masao Someki, Prof. Shinji Watanabe</span>
    

    <p><p>Optimized the open-source ESPnet speech toolkit to support ONNX exporting via the PyTorch ONNX API.</p>
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/neuromv/">
      NeuroMV
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>A Neural Music Visualizer</span><br/>
    <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ Kayo Yin, Maya Shen, Kevin Chen</span>
    

    <p><p>In this project, we visualize songs using images that pulsate and move along with music using a type of neural network called a Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN).</p>
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/multimodal/">
      Pipeline models for VQA on VizWiz
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>Tackling challenges in visual question answering for the blind community</span><br/>
    <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ I-Tsun Cheng, Qi Jiang, Lyuyang Hu, Yuanyuan Wang</span>
    

    <p><p>In this project, we adapted pre-trained image classification models like ResNet and ViT to the task of speech emotion recognition. We found that using the pretrained weights had some benefit over training from scratch even though the domains are significantly different.</p>
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/planetary_defender/">
      Planetary Defender
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>A simple arcade-y space shooter game made with Unity</span><br/>
    <span>Personal | 2021</span><br/>

    

    <p><p>Iâ€™ve always been interested in game design and development, so this was a simple project to learn the basics of the Unity game engine.</p>
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/figqa/">
      Fig-QA (Published @ NAACL 2022)
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>Testing the ability of language models to interpret figurative language</span><br/>
    <span>CMU | 2021</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ Emmy Liu, Chen Cui, Prof. Graham Neubig</span>
    

    <p><p>In this project, we designed and crowdsourced a novel benchmark dataset containing pairs of similes/metaphors along with their literal interpretations. We then analyzed the performance of modern language models to understand their strengths and limitations for this task. Published at NAACL 2022.</p>
</p>

    <span>CMU | 2021</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ Dong Hyun Lee, James Li, Sanika Natu</span>
    

    <p><p>In this project, we adapted pre-trained image classification models like ResNet and ViT to the task of speech emotion recognition. We found that using the pretrained weights had some benefit over training from scratch even though the domains are significantly different.</p>

    <h3>
      <a href="/projects/directed_study/">
      Unsupervised audio labeling
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span>Investigating pseudo-labeling techniques for a large audio event dataset</span><br/>
    <span>CMU | 2021</span><br/>

    
    <span>w/ Ankit Shah, Prof. Bhiksha Raj</span>
    

    <p><p>I was given access to the YFCC-100M dataset, which contains over 8000 hours of audio data scraped from videos on Flickr. I created a preprocessing pipeline to extract and clean the audio data, and investigated some techniques to perform pseudo-labeling and self-training using the data.</p>
