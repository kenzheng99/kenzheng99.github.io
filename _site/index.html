<p>
  I'm a second-year master's student studying machine learning for language technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about applying ML in a variety of domains, and have worked on projects involving speech, NLP, vision, and more. I also have experience in software and web development through many industry internships - most recently, I worked at SoundHound and helped develop their voice AI system for restaurant ordering. 

</p>

<p>
  This website is a work in progress, so please excuse the simple layout for now! I'm building  it from scratch using Jekyll to sharpen my web design and frontend development skills.

<h2>Featured Projects</h2>

Here's a showcase of a few projects I've been working on during my time at CMU.
<ul>


  

  
    <li>
      <h3>
        <a href="/projects/espnet_onnx/">
        ESPnet ONNX
        </a>
      </h3>
      <span>Optimizing the ESPnet speech toolkit for production applications</span><br/>
      <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

      
      <span>w/ Karthik Ganesan, Samarth Navali, Masao Someki, Prof. Shinji Watanabe</span>
      

      <p><p>Optimized the open-source ESPnet speech toolkit to support ONNX exporting via the PyTorch ONNX API.</p>
</p>
    </li>
  

  
    <li>
      <h3>
        <a href="/projects/neuromv/">
        NeuroMV
        </a>
      </h3>
      <span>A Neural Music Visualizer</span><br/>
      <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

      
      <span>w/ Kayo Yin, Maya Shen, Kevin Chen</span>
      

      <p><p>In this project, we visualize songs using images that pulsate and move along with music using a type of neural network called a Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN).</p>
</p>
    </li>
  

  
    <li>
      <h3>
        <a href="/projects/multimodal/">
        Pipeline models for VQA on VizWiz
        </a>
      </h3>
      <span>Tackling challenges in visual question answering for the blind community</span><br/>
      <span>CMU | 2022</span><br/>

      
      <span>w/ I-Tsun Cheng, Qi Jiang, Lyuyang Hu, Yuanyuan Wang</span>
      

      <p><p>In this project, we adapted pre-trained image classification models like ResNet and ViT to the task of speech emotion recognition. We found that using the pretrained weights had some benefit over training from scratch even though the domains are significantly different.</p>
</p>
    </li>
  

  

  
    <li>
      <h3>
        <a href="/projects/figqa/">

      <span>CMU | 2021</span><br/>

      
      <span>w/ Emmy Liu, Chen Cui, Prof. Graham Neubig</span>
      

      <p><p>In this project, we designed and crowdsourced a novel benchmark dataset containing pairs of similes/metaphors along with their literal interpretations. We then analyzed the performance of modern language models to understand their strengths and limitations for this task. Published at NAACL 2022.</p>
