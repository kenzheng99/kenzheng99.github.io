  I'm a second-year master's student studying machine learning for language technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about applying ML in a variety of domains, and have worked on projects involving speech, NLP, vision, and more. I also have experience in software and web development through many industry internships - most recently, I worked at SoundHound and helped develop their voice AI system for restaurant ordering.

<p>
  This website is a work in progress, so please excuse the simple layout as I build it from scratch!
