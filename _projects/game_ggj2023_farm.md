This was my first in-person game jam, I had a lot of fun working with a group from my game development class on this 
project! I took the lead on programming, developing most of the core game mechanics and integrating everyone's work
into the Unity project. Check it out on [itch.io](https://kentoshin.itch.io/farm-of-the-people){:target="_blank"}!
