intro: >
  Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm currently a software engineer at HPE.
  I'm a 🐕‍🦺 CMU 23' masters alum, 🐦 JHU '21 undergrad, was born in 🇺🇸 and grew up in 🇭🇰. I'm a learner and a hobby
  collector at heart - at work, my goal is to touch as many pieces of a tech stack as I can, and at home I love
  deep-diving into both technical and creative projects. This site aims to showcase everything that I've worked on,
  so please take a look!

  This website is a work in progress, so please excuse the simple layout as I build it from scratch.

projects: >
  Here's a pretty exhaustive list of every project I've worked on during my college and graduate years. 
  This page is very much a work in progress, and more details will be added to each project eventually!
