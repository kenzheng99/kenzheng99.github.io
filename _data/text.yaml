intro: >
  I'm a second-year master's student studying machine learning for language technologies at Carnegie Mellon University.
  I'm passionate about applying ML in a variety of domains, and have worked on projects involving speech, NLP, vision, and more.
  I also have experience in software and web development through many industry internships - most recently, I worked at SoundHound
  and helped develop their voice AI system for restaurant ordering.
